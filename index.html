                            <p>There are four types of card in this deck, each portraying a specific cocktail. Each is worth a certain amount of points earned or taken away from your total score if chosen for your collection. Below is a table that shows all of the cards and their point values. There are 108 cards in this deck</p>

                            <p>This deck includes the same four types of cards as in the Cocktail deck. The difference is that with this one there are only cards that take away points from your final score. A list below shows the contents of this deck. This is the deck that is shuffled into the Cocktail Deck thereby changing your odds. There are 108 cards in this deck.</p>

                        <h2><b>The Game Deck</b></h2>
                            <p>In this game, there are six suites. They include Hearts, Diamonds, Spades, Clubs and two new suites of Skulls and Swords. Each suite has the normal card ranks (3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, Jack, Queen, King, Ace) with Ace being a high card following King to make up a deck of 83 cards. Notice that the rank of 2 has been removed to make way for five Bonus cards. More on these Bonus Cards later.</p>
                            <h2><b>The Hands</b></h2>
                            <p>You will go through 15 hands drawing from your Game Deck by clicking the "show next hand" button. When you see the five cards of your hand, click on two. Those cards will be sent to your collection which can be seen below your hand. 
                            <h2><b>The Bonus Cards</b></h2>
                            <p>For the first five hands the first card will always be a Bonus card. These are the cards that display a circular poker chip image with a number in the center which represents the five points it is worth. The deck is shuffled before you start your first hand and every hand thereafter. The bonus card is the only card that is not chosen randomly. Every other card in your first five hands and every card in the next 10 hands is chosen randomly after the game deck is shuffled. If you choose a bonus card it is added to your collection like any other card and you are automatically awarded 5 points when your collection is evaluated at the end of the game. The other important thing to know about these cards is that if you choose one of these cards, four Cocktail Cards are added to the game deck and the game deck is shuffled. More on the Cocktail Cards later.</p>
                            <h2><b>The Cocktail Cards</b></h2>
                            <p> There are four Cocktail Cards. These include a Rum and Coke, Gin and Tonic, Long Island Iced Tea, and Margarita. They always have a point value associated with the card and a polarity being positive or negative although these traits aren't shown on the card face. If these cards are in your collection when your collection is evaluated, you are awarded the point value associated with the card if the polarity is positive and this point value is taken away from your total score if the polarity is negative. There are no Cocktail Cards present in your game deck to begin with. The Cocktail Cards are present in two additional decks. More on these decks later. They are added to your game deck via choosing bonus cards. Therefore if you never choose a bonus card, you will never see a Cocktail Card in your hand because none were added to the game deck. If you choose more bonus cards during your first five hands however, more Cocktail Cards will be added to your game deck.</p>
                            <h2><b>The Cocktail Deck and the Deal-In Cocktail Deck </b></h2>
                            <p>There are two additional decks to your game deck, The Cocktail Deck and the Deal-In Cocktail Deck. These decks are both shuffled at the beginning of the game. Both of these decks consist of all Cocktail Cards- the Rum and Coke, Gin and Tonic, Long Island Iced Tea and Margarita. Click on the "See Decks" button to see the composition of each deck. The difference between the two decks is the Cocktail Deck has both positive and negative Cocktail Cards. The Deal-In Cocktail Deck has only negative Cocktail Cards. Click on the "See Decks" button to see the composition of both of these decks including point values of the different Cocktail Cards.</p>
                            <h2><b>Choosing Cocktail Cards</b></h2>
                            <p>When you choose a Cocktail Card and send it to your collection a certain amount of cards are taken from your Deal-In Cocktail deck and put in your Cocktail deck. One card is added for a Rum and Coke, Two for a Gin and Tonic, Three for a Long Island Iced Tea, and five for a Margarita. Also a certain amount of cards are taken from your Cocktail deck and put into your Game Deck. One card is added for a Rum and Coke, two for a Gin and Tonic or a Long Island Iced Tea and three for a Margarita. In this way, as you choose Cocktail Cards from your hand the chances of you choosing a positive Cocktail Card the next time decreases more and more. Also after these cards are dealt into your Game Deck and Cocktail Deck, both the Cocktail Deck and Game Deck are shuffled.</p>
                            <h2><b>Changing Collection Order</b></h2>
                            <p>At any time, you can go down to your collection and click on two cards. Two additional buttons will show up next to the "Go To Confirmation Stage" button, the "Swap" and "Reset" buttons. If you click the "Reset" button, the buttons will disappear and nothing will happen. If you click the "Swap " button, the two cards will switch positions.</p>
                            <h2><b>Scoring and Confirmation</b></h2>
                            <p>The goal of the game is to score the most points. You can score points by having Bonus Cards in your collection which are added to your total, by having a specific five card combination in one of your six cards sets visible in the six rows of your collection, or by having a Cocktail card in your collection and being awarded it's associated point total. Click on the "See Point Values" button to see how much points each combination is worth. But beware the Cocktail cards can also take points away from your final score depending on if the card is positive or negative. At the end of the game after you choose your final two cards during your fifteenth hand, the "Go To Confirmation Stage" button will appear under the "Your Collection" heading. When your collection is in the order you wish click the "Go To Confirmation Stage" button. At this point you will be unable to change the position of the cards in your collection. Two more buttons will appear, the "Evaluate Sets" and "Get Final Score" buttons. Clicking on the "Evaluate Sets" button will calculate your final score based on all six rows of your collection. The first set of 5 will evaluate to add a point value to your total score based on the highest valued card combination present. The second, third, fourth, fifth and sixth sets will do the same. Then each set of five will be checked for any Bonus or Cocktails and those points will be added or subtracted. The "Evaluate Sets" button will disappear. Then you are ready to click on the "Get Final Score" button to see your total final score.</p>
                            <h2><b>Adding a Wager</b></h2>
                            <p>The one additional way a player can earn extra points would be by adding a wager. This is completely optional and a player can just skip adding a wager if they desire. The button to add a wager will appear after you hit the "Go to Confirmation Stage" button if you have chosen a Cocktail Card during one of your hands. It will appear next to the "Evaluate Sets" and "Get Final Score" buttons. Before hitting the "Evaluate Sets" and "Get Final Score" buttons, a player has the option to click the "Make Wager" button and type in a number. It has to be a number and it can't contain decimal points. Then your wager will show up next to the "Evaluate Sets" and "Get Final Score" buttons. After you click the "Evaluate Sets" and "Get Final Score" buttons you will see a message explaining the results of your wager. You are wagering on the net total of points you will receive from just the cocktail cards in your collection. If you wager more than the net total then your wagered points will be subtracted from your final score. If you match your wager with the net total your wagered points will be added to your final score. If your wager is less than the net total then you will get your wagered points added to your final score minus the difference between your wager and the net total. If your wager is less than the net total and the difference between your wager and the net total is equal to or more than the amount of points you wagered, then you don't gain or lose any points.</p>
                            <h2><b>Adding a Wager Example</b></h2>
                            <p>So for example, lets say your net total is 100 cocktail points. If you wagered 110 points, then you would lose an additional 110 points. If you wagered 100 points, you would gain an additional 100 points. If you wagered 90 points, then you would gain 80 points. If you wagered 50 points, you wouldn't gain or lose any additional points.</p>
